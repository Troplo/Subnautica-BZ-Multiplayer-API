# Subnautica-BZ-Multiplayer-API

## Overview
A very simple reimplementation of the Subnautica: Below Zero multiplayer API to make it happy.

## Usage
Pass `-apiEndpoint https://yourserver.com/api/` to the game. You need <a href="https://github.com/Troplo/Subnautica-BZ-Multiplayer-Linux">Subnautica-BZ-Multiplayer-Linux</a> installed.

## License
It's only 60 lines of code, so MIT I guess.

## Installation
1. Git clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
3. Run `npm start` to start the API server.
